# Project Title : Diagnosis of Breast Cancer using Gabor wavelet and Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis from Digitized Mammogram Images 

## Abstract
In this article, we will present an automatic method of classifying mammography images into three categories: normal, benign and malignant, in which image features are first extracted using Gabor filters and LSD analysis, and in the next step, using different classification methods. We tested the presented method on DDSM database data and show that these features achieved better results than other algorithms using K-NN classification algorithm. The presented system can be used in different places such as clinics and hospitals.

## Proposed Method
1- Pre-processing breast images
   •	Convert image to grayscale
   •	average filter for denoising
   •	global thresholding technique for getting regions of tissues


2- Feature extraction using Gabor filter 

3- Dimensionality reduction using LSDA

4- Feature classification using K-NN




## Dataset
•	DDSM Dataset available in src folder.


## How to Use

•	Open Main.m and run it.
